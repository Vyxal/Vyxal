# Tips and Tricks

## Arithmetic Advice

1. A pair of numbers in a list should be multiplied with `Π`
2. Use the builtins for numbers or `E` for a power of 2
3. `~` can compress any number less than 65535 in two bytes using base-255, which can save bytes over regular number compress in base 252 with the open/close elements. For example, `~ꜝꜝ~••;“⌊` is 9 bytes for `6553564764` whereas the compressed number `"Aᶲᵞġ+ėYȦQ₂”` is 12 bytes

## Lists and Lambdas

1. `Ω` and `ƛ` will convert a number to a range and iterate over it automatically.
2. Some common elements that don't vectorize have a version that does vectorize, like `L` and `l` for length and `Ṛ` and `V` for reverse.

## String Stuff

1. String compression only works on lowercase letters


## Function Fun

1. `)` closes two structures which has been used exactly once
2. the context variable `n` is what item you are currently on, `m` is the index

## Miscellanious Magic

1. Flags are your friends.
2. -1 is truthy, the only falsy values are the empty string, the empty list and zero.
