# Version 3.4.0

_The OOPdate_

## Breaking Changes

* Lambdas operating on the stack (with `!` in the parameter list) will now assign
to any arguments that aren't `!`s
* Set operations no longer uniquify their result. 

## New Elements

* `ÞẠ` performs multi-dimensional assignment. That is, it sets an item in a ragged
list
* `Þi` performs multi-dimensional indexing. That is, it gets an item in a ragged
list

## New Overloads

* `i` will retrieve an attribute of a record, assuming the attribute is readable in context.
* `Ạ` will write to an attribute of a record, assuming the attribute is writable in context. 

## Bug Fixes

* Set operations no longer uniquify their result. Instead, they behave like APL set operations.

## Other Changes (QoL, Interpreter, Ecosystem, etc)

* There's now a redefine-element structure to allow for custom elements and modifiers.
* There's also now support for OOP through Records and extension methods.

## Closing Remarks

* In the next release, expect codepage changes, a changed list of modifiers, better symbol choices for built-ins, and the introduction of a lot of missing things like combinations, random choice, etc.
