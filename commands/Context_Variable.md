# `n` - Context Variable

(From the tutorial)
The context variable is a variable that pushes a value based on the _context_ of the current structure/scope. In a for-loop, the context variable is the current iteration value. In a function/lambda, the context variable is the arguments passed. In a while-loop, the context variable is the result of the condition.
