Pushes the object reference of a user-defined function. Note that this only applies to `@` defined functions. Analogous to the following:

```py
def function():
   pass

stack.append(function) # Doesn't call function but instead it's object.
```

# Usage
```
°function;║⟨<reference to function>⟩ # ° followed by the function name followed by ;
```
