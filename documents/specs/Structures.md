# Structure Specifications

Very simply, a _structure_ is an element that is made of sub-elements grouped together. Structures can have branches that impact either a) the attributes of the structure or b) how the structure is executed. Branches are created by using `|`.

Here is a list of every structure defined within version 2:

- If statement
- For loop
- While loop
- Defined function
- Lambda
    - Map
    - Filter
    - Sort
- Variables

<!-- TODO: Hyperlink each item to its appropriate subheading -->

## If Statement

The full form of an if statement is as so:

```
[Truthy Branch|Falsey Branch]
```

With only 1 branch, the `Falsey` branch is considered to be empty.

The if statement pops a single value off the stack - we'll call it `x`. If `x` is a function, it is evaluated as if it was called using `†`. `x` is then set to the result of the function (`x = x()`). This is repeated until a non-function value is returned. The context variable (`n`) is set to `x`.

If `x` is a truthy value (non-zero for numeric values, non-empty for strings and lists), then the code in the `Truthy` branch will be executed. Otherwise, the `Falsey` branch will be executed.

## For Loop

The full form of a for loop is as so:

```
(Loop Variable|Loop Code)
```

With only 1 branch, the `Loop Variable` branch is considered to use the context variable (`n`). Note that `(n|...)` and `(...)` are NOT equivalent.

The for loop pops a single value off the stack - we'll call it `x`. If `x` is a function, it is evaluated as if it was called using `†`. `x` is then set to the result of the function (`x = x()`). This is repeated until a non-function value is returned. If `x` is numeric, `x` is set to the range `[0, ⌊x⌋)`.

For each item in `x`, the `Loop Code` branch is executed, with the item being stored in the variable contained in the `Loop Variable` branch.

## While Loop

The full form of a while loop is as so:

```
{Loop Condition|Loop Code}
```

With only 1 branch, the `Loop Condition` branch is considered to be always truthy (think infinite loop).

Each iteration of the while loop, `Loop Condition` is executed on the main stack. The top of the stack is then popped, and if it is truthy, `Loop Code` is executed. Otherwise, control flow moves out of the while loop and on to the rest of the program.

## Defined Function

The full form of a function definition is as so:

```
@Function Name:Function Parameters|Function Code;
```

Without the `Function Code`, it is considered to be calling the function named `Function Name`.

### Function Parameters

The function parameter syntax can be described as the following regex:

```regex
\*|((\d+|\w+):?)*(\d+|\w+)
```

If no parameters are specified, it is assumed that the function pops no arguments.

When executing a function, arguments are popped off the current stack to fill each parameter: numbers pop that many arguments and push them to the function's stack, names pop a single argument and place it into a local variable with the same name. The entire function stack is pushed back onto the stack at the end of the function.

## Lambdas

There are 4 types of lambdas: normal, map, filter, sort. The full form of a normal lambda is as follows:

```
λLambda Arity|Lambda Body;
```

With only 1 branch, `Lambda Arity` is assumed to be `1`.

When executing a lambda, the relevant number of arguments are popped from the stack and placed into the lambda's stack. Only the top of the lambda's stack is returned.

All the other lambdas are just normal lambdas but with different opening characters and without arity.

## Variables

The full structure of a variable is expressible through the following regex:

```regex
[→←](\w+|\_)?
```
