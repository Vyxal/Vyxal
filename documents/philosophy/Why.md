# _Why_ is Vyxal?

Most golfing languages are created with the intent of terse code - a goal that is obviously essential to the very core of what a golfing language is. However, this is
mostly done at the expense of losing constructs within traditional programming languages that make things simple to do. Vyxal's raison d'être is to provide structures
of practical languages - such as functions, variables and comments - that are oftentimes lost within the modern golfing language market.

Another reason for Vyxal is to provide an easy to use golfing language that anyone can quickly pick up - by providing tools that both new and experienced users are
familiar with, Vyxal aims to cater to a wide demographic of golfers.

Put simply, Vyxal exists because golfers need a golfing language - and because golfing languages could be better.
