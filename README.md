# What is this fresh beginnings branch?

The code clean up made everything a big mess. That isn't anyone's fault. The code just wasn't suited to such a big change. It's more my fault for not organising it properly.
I'm sorry for the confusion and miscommunications that happened during the whole process - it all went so fast, and I barely have any experience with managing a somewhat large scale project. 


This is my chance to make things right - to reactor Vyxal in a way that is clean, maintainable and less messy. This time, it'll be built by the community.

My own personal hopes for this project are:

- that communication is clear among contributors 
- that the fires of v2.5.3 are put out 
- that Vyxal is rewritten with unity and clarity
- that we discuss changes in a way that the majority of people know exactly what's happening
- and that we never have this problem again. 

If someone knows how best to manage a project like this, and they desire to take charge of the rewrite, tell me. I'd be more than happy to follow the suggestions and guidance of someone else who actually knows what they are doing. 

Some things to note:

- I want to keep the current parser and dictionary - those are good
- We're implementing the v2 command list 
- Everyone's opinions should be expressed 
- This is a refactoring/rewrite, NOT a new language 
- Vyxal will still be transpiled. Unless someone presents a feasibile way to make vyxal interpreted, I want to stick with the simpler option. 

There's a high chance I've missed a lot of things in this document, so take all this with the idea that this is a launch pad. Everything is subject to change now.

Here's to the hopes of a better Vyxal
